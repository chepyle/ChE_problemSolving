# Chemical Engineering Problem Solving with Python Notebooks
This repository is a quick Matlab-to-Python translation of  M. Shacham's "Using Templates for Demonstrating Good Programming Practices" submitted to the [2015 Annual AIChE meeting](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2015/webprogram/Paper421920.html).
